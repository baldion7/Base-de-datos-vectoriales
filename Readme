## Overview
SafeSessionState is designed to provide thread-safe access to session state data in multi-threaded web applications. It implements a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent modifications while maintaining high performance through the use of reentrant locks.

## Features
- ‚ú® Thread-safe session state management
- üîí Reentrant lock mechanism for concurrent access
- üîÑ Automatic yield point detection
- üéØ Widget state synchronization
- üîç Query parameter handling
- üìä Serializable state validation

## System Architecture

Here's how SafeSessionState works:

## Requirements

### Minimum System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Threading support
- 64MB RAM minimum
- 100MB disk space

### Dependencies
- protobuf>=3.0.0
- threading (standard library)
- contextlib (standard library)
- typing (standard library)

## Installation

```bash
pip install safe-session-state
```

## Usage

Basic example of using SafeSessionState:

```python
from safe_session_state import SafeSessionState

# Initialize the session state
session_state = SafeSessionState(state, lambda: None)

# Set a value
session_state["user_name"] = "John Doe"

# Get a value
user_name = session_state["user_name"]

# Use with query parameters
with session_state.query_params() as params:
    current_page = params.get("page", 1)
```
